# Test code for a Packing Exchange Format for video

The repo contains test code for a possible packing format for sending video between applications in a way that can provide a good compromise between packing density, complexity of packing/unpacking and support for different bit depths.

See [VSF Cloud Exchange Format](https://github.com/vsf-tv/cef) and [this IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-weaver-pef) for more context and details information.
